Input

The program begins by not taking any direct user inputs but instead works with predetermined data that creates the framework of the resume. Details including name, contact information, education, work history, skills, and projects are hardcoded into the Resume.js file. These inputs serve as fixed data components that fill the various sections of the resume. Moreover, styles for both layout and appearance are specified in Resume.css.

Process

The application utilizes React.js to dynamically display the resume information. Elements like Resume.js arrange the information into organized segments including header, education, work history, skills, and projects. Styling is implemented through Resume.css to improve readability and conform to the defined design. React's declarative syntax guarantees seamless rendering of updates. The program also makes use of links to project repositories, allowing for interactivity.

Output

The result is a completely responsive, aesthetically pleasing resume presented as a web page. The resume sections are presented in an organized, easy-to-navigate format with a polished look, preparing it for online viewing.
