# Input 

The application receives user input via forms in different components. Users can create a new recipe by entering information like the name, ingredients, and directions. In the same way, they can change a current recipe by altering the given input fields. The application retrieves current recipe data through API requests, allowing users to access and alter saved information. The input is checked prior to processing to ensure data integrity. 

# Procedure 

After the user provides input, the application handles the data by sending HTTP requests to a backend API. To add a recipe, a POST request is made to save the new information. Modifying a recipe initiates a PUT request, which updates the relevant record. The program retrieves saved recipes through GET requests and allows for deletion via DELETE requests. State management guarantees that UI elements refresh automatically when there are modifications in the database. 

# Output

The program shows the collection of recipes in an organized format. When users create, modify, or remove a recipe, the revised list is shown instantly. Users can access specific recipe information, where they encounter well-organized data. Feedback, including success notifications and error messages, is presented correctly to enhance user experience. The UI features an attractive and adaptable design, guaranteeing smooth interaction on various devices.
